# About Me

Hello, I'm Abdul Karim Mia, and I specialize in Photoshop and Illustrator automation using Javascript. I also develop CEP plugin panels for these programs to enhance their functionality. As a website designer, I have expertise in WordPress and have been working on Fiverr for 4 years, helping clients achieve their creative goals.

On my [portfolio website](https://www.abdulkarimmia.com/), you can find some of the scripts and plugins that I have developed. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies, and my passion for my work is evident in the high-quality products that I produce.

Aside from design and development, I also love to play cricket and computer games, and I enjoy traveling to new places. If you have a design or development project in mind, feel free to [contact me](https://www.abdulkarimmia.com/contact).
